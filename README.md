## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**  
   This project uses CDN scripts for React and Babel, so no npm install is required for running.

2. **Run the app**  
   Open `index.html` in your browser.  
   The app uses `HashRouter` for client-side routing.

3. **Development**  
   - Source code is in JSX and ES6 modules, compiled in-browser using Babel.
   - Main entry point: [`app.js`](app.js)
   - Routing and main layout: [`RootCmp.jsx`](RootCmp.jsx)

## Styling

- Main styles are in [`assets/css/main.css`](assets/css/main.css)
- Each app and component has its own CSS file imported in `main.css`

## Notable Files

- **Mail Service**: [`apps/mail/services/mail.service.js`](apps/mail/services/mail.service.js)
- **Note Service**: [`apps/note/services/note.service.js`](apps/note/services/note.service.js)
- **Book Service**: [`apps/books/services/book.service.js`](apps/books/services/book.service.js)
